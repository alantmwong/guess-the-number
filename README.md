Guess the number mini project

This game generates a random number from 1 to 100 and asks the user to 
guess it, allowing for a certain amount of attempts before the user loses the game. 
The user can set the difficulty for either easy or hard, meaning they'll get 5 or 10
attempts respectively to guess the random number.
